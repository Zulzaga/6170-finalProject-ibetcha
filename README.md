Important information:
============================

As we discussed during the last meeting, we decided to not to implement Venmo during this phase. Instead, we created new PaymentRequest collection to keep track of the payments (debts) between users.

- Tests:
Whenever the tests are run, we clear all the collections in the database. Therefore, all the datas in the database will be lost after the tests are run.

- Milestones generation:
First milestone starts one day after the start date, and the start date is at the earliest tomorrow to allow time for the monitors to accept the monitor requests.

- New Collections: FriendRequest, PaymentReques and MonitorRequest
In order to add monitors and friends, we decided to create Monitor Requests and Friend Requests collections.
